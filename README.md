# T7-CPU
Development of an application capable of simulating a T7 CPU, with the ability to load from file and execute arbitrary T7 programs. 

# What is T7?
T7 is assembly-like language that is Turing complete and contains only 7 opcodes (instructions).

# The project
Team-based development of an application that can simulate a T7 CPU and is able to load from a file and execute arbitrary T7 commands. The application will have an additional DUMP instruction that will be introduced to print the state of the CPU and memory to aid debugging. The application will also provide a minimalist debugger with GUI which displays the state of the memory and registers as each instruction is executed.
